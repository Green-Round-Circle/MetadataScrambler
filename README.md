# MetadataScrambler
A Python CLI tool to read, edit, delete, and scramble metadata from files
(images, videos, audio, documents, and archives).

This tool helps you review your files’ metadata, allowing you to remove it, scramble it randomly while keeping the same size, or edit it manually. This is my first project, and the inspiration came from a quote by a former NSA chief:
> We kill people based on metadata.
